pnpm build

# Start production server
pnpm start

# Run ESLint
pnpm lint

# Fix ESLint errors automatically
pnpm lint:fix

# Run tests in watch mode
pnpm test

# Run tests once (CI/CD)
pnpm test:ci

# Utility scripts
pnpm images:grab          # Download/process portfolio images
pnpm images:compress      # Compress portfolio images for web optimization
pnpm scan:links           # Scan site for broken links
pnpm crawl:internal       # Crawl internal links (requires dev server running)
pnpm build:pdfs           # Generate PDF versions of markdown content (runs automatically after build)
```

## Architecture

### Data Strategy (Mock Data for Client Preview)

All data is currently stored in JSON files under `/content/`:
- `services.json` - Service offerings and pricing packages
- `testimonials.json` - Customer reviews
- `faqs.json` - Frequently asked questions
- `posts/` - Blog posts as Markdown/MDX files (`.md` or `.mdx`)

**Important**: This is intentionally using mock/static data for client preview. Once approved, you can plug in real APIs and backend services.

### Blog System

The blog uses a file-based system with Markdown/MDX support:
- Blog posts live in `content/posts/` as `.md` or `.mdx` files
- Posts are read server-side via `lib/posts.ts` (`listPosts()`, `readPost()`)
- Markdown is parsed with `marked` and sanitized with `isomorphic-dompurify`
- Dynamic routes: `/blog` (list) and `/blog/[slug]` (individual post)
- Post slugs are derived from filenames (e.g., `welcome.mdx` â†’ `/blog/welcome`)
- To add a post: create a new `.md` or `.mdx` file in `content/posts/`

### Key Features

1. **SEO Optimized**: Schema.org structured data, sitemap, robots.txt
2. **Form Validation**: Client-side validation with Zod, server-side parsing
3. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first Tailwind CSS with custom carbon fiber background pattern
4. **Dynamic Routes**: Service detail pages generated from JSON using `generateStaticParams()`
5. **Map Integration**: Embedded Google Maps on contact/location pages

### Form Handling Pattern

Forms use React Hook Form with Zod validation:
- Schemas defined in `lib/validators.ts` (`ContactSchema`, `EstimateSchema`)
- API routes (`app/api/contact/route.ts`, `app/api/estimate/route.ts`) parse with Zod before processing
- Email sent via `lib/mailer.ts` (Resend integration, falls back to mock if API key not set)
- All forms require consent checkbox (`z.literal(true)`)

### Custom Tailwind Utilities

Global styles in `app/globals.css` define reusable classes:
- `.container` - max-width container with responsive padding
- `.btn` - styled button with glass effect and hover states
- `.input` - form input with glass background
- `.card` - content card with backdrop blur and border
- `.badge` - small labeled element with rounded border
- `.grid-auto` - responsive auto-fill grid (min 260px columns)

### Configuration

- Update business info in `lib/seo.ts` (phone, email, address, coordinates)
- Environment variables in `.env.local` (copy from `.env.example`)
- Add portfolio images to `public/images/portfolio/`
- Replace placeholder OG image at `public/og/hero.jpg`

### Environment Variables

Required for full functionality (see `.env.example`):
- `RESEND_API_KEY` - Email notifications via Resend
- `CONTACT_TO` - Email recipient for form submissions (defaults to info@creationcustomsllc.com)
- `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` - Google Maps embed
- `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY` - Google Places API for reviews/ratings
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` - Public site URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CAL_URL` - Booking calendar URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_GBP_URL` - Google Business Profile URL
- `GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` - Google Analytics
- `META_PIXEL_ID` - Meta/Facebook pixel

### Deployment Notes

- Designed for Vercel deployment
- Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard
- Optional: Configure Resend API key for email notifications
- Domain: customcreationssi.com (configured in `lib/seo.ts`)

### Content Management

JSON files in `/content/` drive dynamic content:
- **services.json**: Service slugs, titles, packages, pricing, addons, todos
- **testimonials.json**: Customer reviews with names and ratings
- **faqs.json**: Question/answer pairs for FAQ accordion

Service detail pages at `/services/[slug]` are generated from `services.json` using `generateStaticParams()`. Update JSON to add/modify services without touching page code.

## Testing

This project uses Jest and React Testing Library for testing.

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run tests in watch mode (development)
pnpm test

# Run tests once (CI/CD)
pnpm test:ci

# Run route smoke tests with Vitest
pnpm test:routes
```

### Test Setup

- **Jest Config**: `jest.config.js` - configured for Next.js with custom aliases
- **Setup File**: `jest.setup.js` - imports `@testing-library/jest-dom` for DOM matchers
- **Test Location**: `__tests__/` directory - all test files follow `*.test.tsx` naming pattern
- **Vitest**: Used for route smoke tests in `tests/routes.smoke.test.ts`

### Writing Tests

Tests should use React Testing Library for component testing:

```typescript
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react'
import Component from '@/path/to/component'

describe('Component Name', () => {
  it('renders without crashing', () => {
    render(<Component />)
    expect(screen.getByText(/expected text/i)).toBeInTheDocument()
  })
})
```

### Current Test Coverage

- **Smoke Tests**: Basic rendering tests for homepage (`__tests__/smoke.test.tsx`)
- **TODO**: Add tests for form validation, API routes, and component interactions

## Content Update Instructions

All static content is managed via JSON files in the `/content/` directory. This allows non-technical users to update content without touching code.

### Updating Services (`content/services.json`)

Each service requires:
- `slug`: URL-friendly identifier (used in `/services/[slug]`)
- `title`: Display name
- `description`: Full service description (used on detail pages)
- `summary`: Short description (used on homepage)
- `turnaround`: Expected completion time
- `warranty`: Warranty information
- `addons`: Array of available add-on services
- `packages`: Array of pricing tiers, each with:
  - `name`: Package name
  - `priceFrom`: Starting price (number)
  - `warranty`: Package-specific warranty
  - `turnaround`: Package-specific turnaround
  - `includes`: Array of features/inclusions

**Example:**
```json
{
  "slug": "ceramic-coating",
  "title": "Ceramic Coating",
  "description": "Full service description...",
  "summary": "Short summary for homepage",
  "turnaround": "1-2 days",
  "warranty": "2-5 year manufacturer warranty",
  "addons": ["Wheel coating (+$199)", "Glass coating (+$149)"],
  "packages": [
    {
      "name": "2-Year Protection",
      "priceFrom": 699,
      "warranty": "2-year manufacturer warranty",
      "turnaround": "1-2 days",
      "includes": ["Decon wash", "Single-stage polish", "2-year coating"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Updating Testimonials (`content/testimonials.json`)

Each testimonial requires:
- `name`: Customer name (first name + last initial)
- `vehicle`: Vehicle make/model/year
- `text`: Review text (keep under 200 characters)
- `rating`: Star rating (1-5)

**Example:**
```json
{
  "name": "Michael R.",
  "vehicle": "2019 BMW M4",
  "text": "Flawless repair and perfect paint match. Highly recommend!",
  "rating": 5
}
```

### Updating FAQs (`content/faqs.json`)

Each FAQ requires:
- `q`: Question text
- `a`: Answer text (can include HTML for links, emphasis)

**Example:**
```json
{
  "q": "Do you work with insurance?",
  "a": "Yes. We work with all major insurance carriers and handle the entire claims process."
}
```

The homepage automatically displays the first 6 FAQs. The `/faq` page shows all FAQs.

### Creating Blog Posts (`content/posts/`)

Blog posts are stored as Markdown (`.md`) or MDX (`.mdx`) files:
- Filename becomes the URL slug (e.g., `welcome.mdx` â†’ `/blog/welcome`)
- No frontmatter required (title is auto-generated from slug)
- Markdown is rendered with `marked` library
- HTML is sanitized with `isomorphic-dompurify` before rendering

**Example:**
Create `content/posts/ceramic-coating-guide.md`:
```markdown
# Complete Guide to Ceramic Coating

Ceramic coating provides long-lasting protection...

## Benefits
- UV protection
- Hydrophobic properties
- Enhanced gloss
```

The post will be available at `/blog/ceramic-coating-guide`.
