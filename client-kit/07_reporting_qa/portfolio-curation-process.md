# Portfolio Curation Process

## Intake
- [ ] After each delivery, flag photo set in shared drive (RO# folder).
- [ ] Tag best before/after pairs using color labels.
- TODO: Automate tag via Zap when photos added.

## Selection Criteria
- Showcases each core service (Auto Body Repair, Ceramic Coating, PPF).
- Includes Staten Island recognizable backdrops when possible.
- Displays variety of vehicle types (sedan, SUV, EV, luxury).
- Ensure images are 2000px+ on long edge.

## Editing Workflow
1. Basic exposure and color correction.
2. Remove license plates if customer requests.
3. Export web-ready JPEGs (1920px, 80% quality) and high-res for print.
4. Add subtle watermark bottom-right (TODO: finalize watermark style).

## Publishing
- Upload to `/public/images/portfolio/` following naming convention (`year-make-model-service-before.jpg`).
- Update `app/(site)/portfolio` gallery data if static list used.
- Feature best shots in social content calendar.

## Maintenance
- Quarterly review of gallery to remove outdated work.
- Archive older jobs to `client-kit/archive/portfolio/YYYY/`.
- Track customer consent records alongside each photo set.
