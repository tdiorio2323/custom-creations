# Referral Program Framework

## Offer Structure
- [ ] Referrer receives $100 service credit per completed repair (Auto Body, Ceramic, or PPF).
- [ ] Referred customer receives free detail upgrade or $50 off deductible (confirm legality).
- TODO: Check NYS regulations on deductible assistance incentives.

## Assets Needed
- Referral cards with QR to `https://customcreationssi.com/estimate?ref=CODE`.
- Email template for post-delivery follow-up promoting referral.
- Landing page copy (include form field for referrer name).

## Tracking
- [ ] Capture referral source in CRM (`crm-fields.md`).
- [ ] Auto-generate referral codes per customer.
- [ ] Monthly report summarizing referred leads, conversions, credits due.

## Redemption Flow
1. Customer submits referral form.
2. Advisor verifies eligibility (service value threshold?).
3. Credit applied to referrer’s next service OR mailed as VISA gift card (TODO: choose option).

## Promotion Plan
- Include insert in vehicle handoff folder.
- Mention on invoice email.
- Feature on social media once monthly.

## Legal / Compliance Notes
- Ensure referral credits accounted for in bookkeeping.
- Update terms if partnering with insurance carriers (no fee-splitting).

## Launch Checklist
- [ ] Finalize incentive structure.
- [ ] Design and print referral cards (see `print-collateral.md`).
- [ ] Update CRM workflows to tag referrals.
- [ ] Train staff on script: “Know someone who needs collision or ceramic? Earn $100 when they book.”
